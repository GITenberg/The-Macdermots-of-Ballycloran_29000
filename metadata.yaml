description: "The Macdermots of Ballycloran is a novel by Anthony Trollope. It was\
  \ Trollope's first published novel, which he began in September 1843 and completed\
  \ by June 1845. However, it was not published until 1847. The novel was \"an abysmal\
  \ failure with the reading public.\"\nThe novel was written while Trollope was staying\
  \ in the village of Drumsna, County Leitrim, Ireland.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
